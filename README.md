# Support Vector Classification (SVC) Model Project

## Overview
This repository contains the Python notebook and associated files for the Support Vector Classification (SVC) Model developed during my Machine Learning Internship at F(x) Data Labs, Ahmedabad, India in 2024. The project involves the application of machine learning techniques such as regression, classification, and clustering to analyze company and client datasets.

## Project Structure
- `svc.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code and documentation for the SVC model.
- `data/`: Directory containing datasets used in the project.
- `models/`: Trained model files.
- `docs/`: Documentation and additional notes.

## Technologies Used
- Python: Primary programming language.
- TensorFlow: Used for building machine learning models.
- scikit-learn: Utilized for implementing various machine learning algorithms.
- Jupyter Notebook: For interactive development and presentations.

## Features
- Regression Analysis: Implementation of both binomial and multinomial regression.
- Classification: Support Vector Classification and other classification methods.
- Clustering: Analyzing and grouping data.
- Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering: Preparation of data for modeling.

## Usage
Follow the instructions in the `svc.ipynb` notebook which guide you through the process of loading data, training the model, and evaluating the results.

## Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcome. Please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your proposed changes.
